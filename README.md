Knock detect testing ground, just playing around with STM32F407 and FFT.

> Target points
- ADC conversion with DMA
- FFT conversion 
- fatfs integration and dunp raw 16bit pcm sound to sd-card
- log FFT rezults to analyze on PC
- integrate input signals -> ex. when to start conversion when to stop.
- signal spike in supervise frequency range or just autoput 0-5v based on fft?
